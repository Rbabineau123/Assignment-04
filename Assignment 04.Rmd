#Description:

#This visualization shows hourly wage level by year of expected experience for both men and women. Women are represented by the purple line, while men are represented by the black line. The disparity between wage earned by men and women is observed at almost every level of experience, with exceptions near 1, 7 and 12 years of experience.

#Description:

#This visualization illustrates the relationship between education level and wage (adjusted to 2022 purchasing power). The facet grid function shows compares the relationship between education level and wage for both men and women, side by side. For both genders, wage increases as years of education increases (shown by the line of best fit). Observations representing non-white individuals are shown in blue to show disparities in education and wage level by race.
